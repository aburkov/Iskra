Let me help clarify this point by walking through it step by step.

First, let's note what we have:
1. In the expectation $J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n p_\theta(i)r(i)$, the $p_\theta(i)$ terms are acting as weights
2. In the derivative $\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n r(i)\nabla_\theta p_\theta(i)$, this expression doesn't immediately show the $p_\theta(i)$ terms

However, here's where the log-derivative trick comes in. We can apply it to $\nabla_\theta p_\theta(i)$:

$\nabla_\theta p_\theta(i) = p_\theta(i)\nabla_\theta \log p_\theta(i)$

Substituting this back into our derivative:

$\nabla_\theta J(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n r(i)[p_\theta(i)\nabla_\theta \log p_\theta(i)]$
$= \sum_{i=1}^n p_\theta(i)[r(i)\nabla_\theta \log p_\theta(i)]$

Now we can see that:
1. The original expectation had $p_\theta(i)$ as weights
2. After applying the log-derivative trick, the derivative also has $p_\theta(i)$ as weights

This is what's meant by "naturally appear" - the same probability terms that weight the original expectation end up weighting the derivative, just multiplied by different factors ($r(i)\nabla_\theta \log p_\theta(i)$ instead of just $r(i)$).

This is particularly useful because it means we can estimate the gradient using the same sampling distribution that we use to estimate the original expectation. Would you like me to elaborate on why this sampling connection is important?
